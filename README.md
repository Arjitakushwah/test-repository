Welcome to our Git and GitHub introduction event! This repository serves as a sandbox for you to explore and practice the concepts we'll be covering throughout the event.

Here, you'll learn the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, including how to create and manage repositories, make commits, collaborate with others using pull requests, and more. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to start contributing to open source projects and working with version control like a pro.

Feel free to experiment with the repository and try out different Git commands and workflows. We encourage you to create branches, make changes, and push your code to this repository. Don't worry, this is a safe space for learning, and any changes you make will not affect the original repository.

We hope you enjoy the event and find the experience of using Git and GitHub both valuable and empowering. Happy coding!
